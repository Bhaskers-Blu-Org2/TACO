# What is TACO?
The Tools for Apache Cordova – "TACO" for short – are a set of utilities that make hybrid app development easier, friendlier, and faster. TACO is divided into the following repos:

[/remotebuild](http://github.com/microsoft/remotebuild) – a secure build server to remotely build, run and debug apps using [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io). It sets up a webserver, and handles secure communication/authentication from the client. By default, it supports the taco-remote agent which lets you remotely build, run, and debug iOS apps created using the Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova.

[/vscode-cordova](http://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cordova) - A [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) extension that provides IntelliSense, debug, and build support for Cordova projects.

If you’re looking for the TACO CLI, you can find it in the [taco-cli repo](http://github.com/microsoft/taco-cli), but please note that Microsoft is no longer actively maintaining that project.
